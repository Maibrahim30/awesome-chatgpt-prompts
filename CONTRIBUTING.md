## ✅ **3. Add Contribution Guidelines and Templates**

**Issue:**  
- The repo currently *doesn’t appear* to have a CONTRIBUTING.md or clear contribution rules in the repo root (especially for adding new prompts or formatting).  
- Community contributions are important for awesome lists.  [oai_citation:3‡GitHub](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts/pull/580?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Fix:**  
Add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` that explains:
- How to add new prompts
- How to format titles, prompts, authorship
- How to update the CSV and README consistently

Also add a Pull Request template.

## ✅ **4. Organize Prompts by Category or Format**

**Issue:**  
- Many prompts are long or lack consistent formatting (e.g., some might not label `<system / user>` instructions clearly).  
- There’s no way to filter by use case or category easily.  

**Fix:**  
Consider grouping prompts into structured sections like:
- 🤖 Coding & Debugging
- ✍️ Writing & Editing
- 💼 Business & Planning
- 📚 Education & Learning
- 🎨 Creative & Fun

Each section should have a short description and examples.

## ✅ **5. Clarify License, Standards & Quality Expectations**

**Issue:**  
- Some “awesome” repos include a **license file**, but the purpose of the prompts may require a clear usage disclaimer (e.g., public domain, CC0, etc.).  
- If some prompts are generated by AI, that should be explicitly stated in contributions.  [oai_citation:4‡GitHub](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts/pull/580?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Fix:**  
Include at the top:

```markdown
## 📜 License
This repository and all included prompts are released under **CC0‑1.0 (public domain)**.  
If a prompt was generated by an AI, contributors should mark it with `Generated by ChatGPT` on its contribution line.

## New Prompt Guidelines
To add a new prompt to this repository, a contributor should take the following steps (in their personal fork):
1. Create and test the new prompt.
    - See the [README](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts/blob/main/README.md) for guidance on how to write effective prompts.
    - Ensure prompts generate intended results and can be used by other users to replicate those results.

    `## Prompt Title`

    `Contributed by: [@github_username](https://github.com/github_profile)`

    `> prompt content`

    - <b>Note:</b> If your prompt was generated by ChatGPT, append `<mark>Generated by ChatGPT</mark>` to the "Contributed by" line.
3. Add the prompt to `prompts.csv`.
    - Put the prompt title in the `act` column, and the prompt itself in the `prompt` column.
4. Submit a pull request on the repository's main branch.
    - If possible, provide some documentation of how you tested your prompt and the kinds of results you received.
