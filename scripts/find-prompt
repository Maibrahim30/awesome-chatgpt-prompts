## ✅ **3. Add Contribution Guidelines and Templates**

**Issue:**  
- The repo currently *doesn’t appear* to have a CONTRIBUTING.md or clear contribution rules in the repo root (especially for adding new prompts or formatting).  
- Community contributions are important for awesome lists.  [oai_citation:3‡GitHub](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts/pull/580?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Fix:**  
Add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` that explains:
- How to add new prompts
- How to format titles, prompts, authorship
- How to update the CSV and README consistently

Also add a Pull Request template.

## ✅ **4. Organize Prompts by Category or Format**

**Issue:**  
- Many prompts are long or lack consistent formatting (e.g., some might not label `<system / user>` instructions clearly).  
- There’s no way to filter by use case or category easily.  

**Fix:**  
Consider grouping prompts into structured sections like:
- 🤖 Coding & Debugging
- ✍️ Writing & Editing
- 💼 Business & Planning
- 📚 Education & Learning
- 🎨 Creative & Fun

Each section should have a short description and examples.

## ✅ **5. Clarify License, Standards & Quality Expectations**

**Issue:**  
- Some “awesome” repos include a **license file**, but the purpose of the prompts may require a clear usage disclaimer (e.g., public domain, CC0, etc.).  
- If some prompts are generated by AI, that should be explicitly stated in contributions.  [oai_citation:4‡GitHub](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts/pull/580?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Fix:**  
Include at the top:

```markdown
## 📜 License
This repository and all included prompts are released under **CC0‑1.0 (public domain)**.  
If a prompt was generated by an AI, contributors should mark it with `Generated by ChatGPT` on its contribution line.
✅ 1. Add a Clear Table of Contents

Issue:
	•	Right now the README lacks an easy‑to‑navigate Table of Contents for the prompts or categories. This makes it hard for users to find what they want quickly.
	•	Without a TOC, a long list of prompts becomes difficult to consume.

Fix:
Add a well‑structured clickable TOC at the top of the README that links to sections like:
	•	📚 Prompt Categories (e.g., Coding, Writing, Business)
	•	🧠 Prompt Templates
	•	🔁 Contribution Guidelines
	•	🔍 How to Search / Use Prompts
	•	📦 Prompt CSV / Download Options

⸻

✅ 2. Improve Usage Instructions

Issue:
	•	The Quickstart/Usage section from the repo (e.g., git clone + npm install) seems to be more for the self‑hosting version rather than using the prompts themselves.  ￼

Fix:
Clarify the two primary ways people use this repo:
	1.	Browse the CSV or README directly to copy/paste prompts
	2.	Use the prompts.chat website or local build to browse/search prompts
